# All Machine Learning Algorithms and Prediction Score

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms, including supervised and unsupervised learning methods. It focuses on training models, making predictions, and evaluating performance using different metrics.

Over the past one year, I have dedicated myself to extensive research and hands-on experience in machine learning. This journey involved exploring a wide range of algorithms, experimenting with datasets, and refining models to improve accuracy and reliability. This repository reflects my commitment to mastering ML concepts and practical applications.
