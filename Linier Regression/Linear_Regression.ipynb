    "# Linear Regression\n",
    "#### The interpretability of linear regression is one of its greatest strengths. The modelâ€™s equation offers clear coefficients that illustrate the influence of each independent variable on the dependent variable, enhancing our understanding of the underlying relationships. Its simplicity is a significant advantage; linear regression is transparent, easy to implement, and serves as a foundational concept for more advanced algorithms."

    "## What is the best Fit Line?\n",
    "#### Our primary objective while using linear regression is to locate the best-fit line, which implies that the error between the predicted and actual values should be kept to a minimum. There will be the least error in the best-fit line.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The best Fit Line equation provides a straight line that represents the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. The slope of the line indicates how much the dependent variable changes for a unit change in the independent variable(s)."
